# library-of-tabs
> The OneTab chrome extension is an excellent resourse to save groups of tabs. However it can be easy to delete lists, and does not have any hierarchical structure to the groups. This directory is used to organise lists of groups into folders, and as a way to backup lists. 

TODO setup clipboard in vim / change limit on vim register - for now use `gedit file.txt` to highlight for importing to OneTab
